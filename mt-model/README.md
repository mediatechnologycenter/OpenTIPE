# Machine Translation Model

Minimal implementation of a webserver, providing machine translation as a service using popular libraries and pretrained models.

Two different libraries are supported: HuggingFace and Fairseq.

The library and model to be used can be configured in the .env file using the `MT_MODEL_LIBRARY` and `MT_MODEL_NAME` variables
